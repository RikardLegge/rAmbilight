## rAmbilight

rAmbilight is a home brew project to allow anyone to get a hold of  an easy to use, efficient, affordable Ambient lighting system. It started out as a project for school, but has since then developed into a framework which allows easy manipulation of addressable light strips, using an Arduino micro controller.
